# Task 8: Tree Felling Byproducts

## User Story
As a player, I want to occasionally find small amounts of Green Firewood when felling trees so that I have a small "starter" supply without immediate processing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Harmony patch hooks into tree felling.
- [ ] Felled trees drop ~15% of their log yield as Green Firewood.
- [ ] Minimum drop of 2 Green Firewood per tree.
