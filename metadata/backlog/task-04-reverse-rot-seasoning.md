# Task 4: Reverse-Rot Seasoning System (C#)

## User Story
As a player, I want Green Firewood to eventually turn into Seasoned Firewood while sitting in a stockpile so that I don't always need specialized buildings.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] C# assembly compiles and loads in RimWorld.
- [ ] `CompSeasonable` (or equivalent) logic implemented.
- [ ] Green Firewood transforms into Seasoned Firewood after a set duration.
- [ ] Seasoning speed scales based on ambient temperature.
