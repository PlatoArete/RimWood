# Task 10.5: The Woodpile (Advanced Mechanic)

## User Story
As a player, I want to stack wood into a Woodpile so that it seasons faster than just leaving it in a heap on the ground, even without a roof.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `Woodpile` building defined (Cost: 20 Green Firewood).
- [ ] Building provides 1.5x seasoning multiplier to its contents (or itself).
- [ ] Mechanic: When seasoning is complete, the building transforms/unpacks into 20 Seasoned Firewood.
- [ ] Placement: Outdoors only, no roof required.
- [ ] No research required (Tribal knowledge).
