# Task 9: Visuals & Soot

## User Story
As a player, I want burning Green Firewood to create soot and reduce room beauty so I am incentivized to use cleaner-burning seasoned wood.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Soot filth defined.
- [ ] Green Firewood has a beauty penalty.
- [ ] Using Green Firewood as fuel periodically spawns soot filth in a small radius.
