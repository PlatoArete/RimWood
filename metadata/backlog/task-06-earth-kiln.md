# Task 6: Earth Kiln

## User Story
As a player, I want to use an Earth Kiln to convert wood into Charcoal so I have a lightweight, high-energy fuel for caravans and advanced workbenches.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `EarthKiln` building defined (requires Smithing).
- [ ] Processing logic (slow, low labor) implemented.
- [ ] Conversion ratio (12 Seasoned Firewood -> 3 Charcoal) is accurate.
