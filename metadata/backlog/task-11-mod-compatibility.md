# Task 11: Mod Compatibility

## User Story
As a player using other mods (like Medieval Overhaul), I want RimWood to integrate seamlessly with their wood systems.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `ThingCategoryDef` integration for external wood/plank items.
- [ ] Patches for common fireplace/hearth mods.
- [ ] Specific integration for Medieval Overhaul (planks -> firewood).
