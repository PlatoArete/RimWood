# Task 1: Project Scaffolding

## User Story
As a player, I want to see "RimWood" in my active mod list so I know the foundation is correctly installed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Directory structure created (`About/`, `Defs/`, `Assemblies/`, `Source/`, `Textures/`).
- [ ] `About.xml` contains valid mod name, author, and version.
- [ ] Mod is visible and can be enabled in the RimWorld mod menu.
