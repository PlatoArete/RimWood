# Task 7: Vanilla Overrides (Patches)

## User Story
As a player, I want to use my new fuels in vanilla buildings like Campfires and Stoves, and have the option to disable raw log usage.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] XPath patches add new fuels to `Campfire`, `Stove`, `Smithy`, etc.
- [ ] Mod setting "Allow logs in workbenches" is functional.
- [ ] Raw logs burn less efficiently than processed fuels in these buildings.
